### One-Liner (For Twitter/Social)
Stop wasting hours on manual QA. Let BugHunter AI find bugs, suggest code fixes, and audit your SEO/Accessibility in seconds.

### The "Hook" (Description)
Most developers hate QA. It's slow, tedious, and things always slip through. 

BugHunter AI changes that. We use an autonomous browser engine to scan your site for hidden technical flaws and then use GPT-4 to tell you exactly how to fix them. 

It’s like hiring a Senior QA Engineer for the price of a coffee. ☕

2. ♿ **Accessibility Audit**: Stay WCAG compliant without the headache.
3. 📸 **Visual Evidence**: Full-page screenshots for every audit.
4. 📄 **Enterprise PDF Reports**: Professional reports ready for your clients or team.
